Title:
Cultivating the Jenkins job jungle with Groovy

Description:
At bol.com we have 70+ applications that are built and supported by 1000+ Jenkins jobs. And that amount is growing by the week. Each set of Continuous Delivery pipelines consists of around 10 jobs which are mostly the same for each application. Maintaining these jobs in Jenkins by hand via the UI is a hell of a job and error-prone at best.

What if there was a better way? A way to describe your Continuous Delivery pipelines in code which can be version-controlled, just like your regular code?
There is! By using the Jenkins Job DSL plugin and a bit of Groovy scripting.

In this code intensive talk you will learn how to significantly mitigate your risk of RSI by distilling your manual job configurations into automated scripts that are readable, easy to maintain and version controlled.
